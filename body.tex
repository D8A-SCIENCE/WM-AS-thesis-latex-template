\chapter{Introduction}
This is where the content of your dissertation goes.  You can directly include chapters like the introduction, related work, conclusion, and future work in this file.  You can also call ''\textbackslash input\{\}'' in this file to include your other papers and .tex documents easily.  When looking at the raw .tex version of this section, you can see how to use input and separate chapters as a comment below.

Here I will make a citation: \cite{mobile_marketshare}.  You must have at least one citation for ''\$make all'' to finish successfully!  Also, please note the type of quotations used.
