% Compiling in Ubuntu: use Kile as an editor, and use XeLaTeX button to compile
% Need to instal MS fonts first as follows
%               sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer
%               sudo fc-cache
% After that, check with 
%               fc-match Arial
% Use PDF figures!!! (for some reason EPS figures are not displayed correctly, 
% you can use 'epspdf myfigure.eps' to convert)
%

% Modifications made by Ed Novak

%            Topic: Security And Privacy For Ubiquitous Mobile Devices
% in April 2016 to make the template compile on department machines, via command 
% line (xelatex) and to be easier to use / understand.

% *** FONT ARIAL for thesis  ***
% might not be required for proposal.
%% see https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/23957/how-to-set-font-to-arial-throughout-the-entire-document
%% and http://www.tug.org/fonts/getnonfreefonts/

%%-- This is how to set Arial font using XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX. -- Shanhe
%% See David's note at the beginning of this file how to install Arial font on department machine.
% \usepackage{fontspec} % only use it with XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX
% \setmainfont{Arial}


% %%-- This is how to set Arial font using LaTeX -- Shanhe
% %% If you don't install the font into tex packages, then you will just get Computer Modern font.
% %% How to install uarial package in Mac OS (required MacTeX, /Library/TeX/texbin in your path). *nix with TexLive should be similar. - Shanhe
% %%   1. curl --remote-name https://www.tug.org/fonts/getnonfreefonts/install-getnonfreefonts
% %%   2. sudo texlua install-getnonfreefonts
% %%   3. sudo getnonfreefonts --sys -a
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{uarial}
\renewcommand{\familydefault}{\sfdefault}

% %%-- This is how to use Computer Modern font.
% \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}


%%-- remove bold for table of contents (TOC) as per physical standards
%\renewcommand{\cftchapfont}{\rm } %no bold in toc
%\renewcommand{\cftchappagefont}{\rm } %no bold in toc


% The wmthesis class is based on the latex report class which
% only indents paragraphs if they immediately follow other paragraphs.  The
% dissertation lady says this is wrong.  I tend to give more credence
% to Dr. Knuth (author of TeX) on this issue, since the other way looks really
% crappy.  If you want the first line of every paragraph indented,
% uncomment the next line to include the indentfirst package. -- rem
% \usepackage{indentfirst}
% Not sure if this is still an option -- Ruth


%%-- set penalties 
%% Penalties are the main value that TeX tries to minimise when line or page breaking, They may be inserted explicitly (\penalty125 means that the penalty for breaking at that point is 125). Some penalties are built in to the TeX system and inserted automatically.  Here we custom define a few.
\def\defaultpenalty{1000} \clubpenalty=\defaultpenalty
\widowpenalty=\defaultpenalty


%%----------------------------------------------------------------
% Set the title that will be printed on the Contents page -- Ruth
%%----------------------------------------------------------------
% The negative vspace is used to make sure that only one line is
% between the title and the first line for each of these pages.
